1. Computation of Tokunaga parameter c
   The Tokunaga parameter c is computed using Topology.py, which is designed to run on an HPC system. In the script, the
   range of basins to be processed is controlled by:
   start = int(sys.argv[1])  
   end = int(sys.argv[2])
   To demonstate the workflow for a single basin, users may set start=0 and end=1, which computes the Tokunaga parameter for
   one basin as a demo. On the HPC system, the script is typically executed over multiple index ranges to process all basins in
   parallel.
   
2. Computaion of basin-averaged junction angles
   Basin-averaged junction angles, including side-branching angles and bifurcation angles, are also computed using Geometry.py.

3. Reproducibility of figures
   All figures presented in the main text can be reproduced by running MainText.py
   
4. Input and output datasets
   All input datasets required by Topology.py and Geometry.py, as well as the corresponding output datasets generated by the
   script, and the input datasets required by MainText.py are available at:

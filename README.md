1. Tokunaga parameter c, basin-averaged junction angles, side-branching angles and bifurcation angles can be computed by running Calculations.py on HPC. Set "start = int(sys.argv[1])" and  "end = int(sys.argv[2])" in the Calculation.py as "start=0" and "end=1" to run the code for one basin as a demo to obtain calculated Tokunaga parameter for the basin.
3. The input and resulting datasets of Calculations.py could be obtained: https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/minhui_li_yale_edu/IgASI3ZhskBTQqlB_nuDuVFfAdp4STYwZvTyTFDkBRdfIQc?e=SX1K3J 
4. All figures presented in the main text can be reproduced by running MainText.py. All the input datasets can be obtained at: https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/minhui_li_yale_edu/IgASI3ZhskBTQqlB_nuDuVFfAdp4STYwZvTyTFDkBRdfIQc?e=SX1K3J
